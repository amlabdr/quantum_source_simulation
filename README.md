# quantum_source_simulation
Simulation of quantum source depending on different parameters.
All simulations are using SeQUeNCe whitch is Simulator of QUantum Network Communication (SeQUeNCe). it is an open-source tool that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications.
